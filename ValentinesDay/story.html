    <h1>To my princess 📖</h1>

    <p>When I first met you in 2021, I didn’t think that this talkative girl would be my everything one day.  
        I still remember that day at Pots when I grabbed you and kissed you—I'll never forget it because that was the day I realized you were different.  
        From our first kiss, I could feel the passion and energy, and I knew at that moment I had feelings for you.  
        Our relationship has faced its own challenges, but the fact that you fought and came back to me means we can tackle any challenge together.  
        They say, "If you love someone, let them go, and if they come back, they’re the one." And baby, you came back.  
        I can't wait for us to face our future together and grow as people. ❤️
