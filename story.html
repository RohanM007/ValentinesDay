    <h1> Our Story 📖</h1>

    <h1>To my princess</h1>

    <p><p>
        When we first met, I never imagined how much you would come to mean to me.  
        I still remember the moment I realized you were different—something about you just felt right.  
        From the very start, there was a spark, a connection that I couldn't ignore.  
        We've faced our own challenges, but the fact that we've grown together through it all shows how strong we are.  
        They say, "If you truly care for someone, let them go, and if they return, it was meant to be." And here we are.  
        I can't wait to see what the future holds for us as we continue this journey together. ❤️

        <li>🌸 Our food dates – *"There was nothing better than having a Burger King meal with you"* 🥰</li>
        <li>🎶 Our song – *"You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?"* 💖</li>
        <li>🌎 Our adventures – *"Every minute spent with you feels like an adventure, I can't wait until we finally go on more."* ✨</li>
